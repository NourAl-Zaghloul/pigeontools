A tertiary feature of **pigeontools** is to be able to quickly call up common ggplot2 graph types. This is just for exploratory plots and is not meant for finalised plots to be published or presented.     

> pigeon_plot(method = "default")     

Currently there is only one coded ggplot2 graph: "boxjitter". This produces a box & jitter plot of whatever data it follows.   

***   

**To Use:**      


> ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) + pigeon_plot("boxjitter")

<!-- GRAPH!!! -->
